    Description:ã€€A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

    Actually, I didn't solve this problem perfectly, because the question usually need to save every numbers which it had calculated. 
    However, I bet that if the number of the loop exceeded 500, the number was not Happy Number.
